# USB Descriptor and Request Parser

This repository is based on [USB Descriptor and Request Parser](https://eleccelerator.com/usbdescreqparser/).
This is a single HTML page that even works offline.

The purpose of this repository is to provide scripts in different languages so they can be used e.g. during development and in test scenarios.

Current implementation:

- html: a local copy of the original site
- javascript: simple object oriented rewrite of the javascript code in the web page
- python: port of the javascript implementation

## Development Requirements
